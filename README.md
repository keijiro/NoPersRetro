**NoPersRetro** is a sample project demonstrating the use of the "No Perspective"
interpolation option in Unity 6.3 to recreate classic 3D graphics with texture
warping (perspective distortion), reminiscent of retro gaming aesthetics.

## System Requirements

- Unity 6.3

## Additional Effects

In addition to simulating texture warping with the No Perspective option, this
sample also includes a "wobbling" effect (vertex position quantization) and a
dithering effect, both of which aim to capture the distinctive visual style of
original PlayStation graphics.
